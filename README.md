# PPG_JavaDesktop
Desktop Implementation of PPG using Java and OpenCV

In this project we are demonstrating PPG by feeding a program a vedio recording.

For image related computation I've used OpenCV. 
Make sure you have openCV installed in your system before trying out this code, otherwise it will error out citing linking issues. 

OpenCV version used 3.0.0

Let me know your experience with the code.
